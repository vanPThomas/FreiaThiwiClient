# Changelog
All notable changes to **Freia Thiwi Client** will be documented here.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-08
### Changed
-Upgraded from c-style arrays to proper c++ strings for better legible code

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-07
### Added
- Account-based authentication: login with existing account or create new one
- Tabbed connection panel: "Login" (existing account) and "Create Account" (new account with password confirmation)
- Account password field + confirmation on creation
- Derived account key sent via new PROT4 protocol after PROT2 handshake
- Handles PROT4 SUCCESS/FAIL replies from server with clear messages
- Full round-trip support for account creation and login

### Changed
- `configureWithAccount()` now takes `bool isCreate` flag to distinguish login vs. creation
- Connection flow: PROT2 (transport + username) → PROT4 (account auth) → normal chat
- UI validation for account password fields

### Fixed
- Payload parsing for multi-line PROT3 messages (userList now reads all names correctly)

This version brings real user accounts to Freia Thiwi, making it possible to have persistent, per-user identities while keeping the ultra-lightweight spirit intact.
